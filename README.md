# Socket Programming in Python

This project demonstrates a simple client-server architecture using Python's socket programming capabilities. The server listens for incoming connections and echoes back any messages received from the client.

## Project Structure

- `server.py`: The server script that listens for connections and handles incoming messages.
- `client.py`: The client script that connects to the server and sends messages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Start the Server

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `server.py`.
3. Run the server script:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
## Step 2: Start the Client
1. Open another terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory containing client.py.
3. Run the client script:
    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```
